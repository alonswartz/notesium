Notesium (pronounced *no-tes-ee-im*), is an opiniated, simplistic yet
powerful system for creating, storing and accessing knowledge by means
of *notes*.

It aspires and is designed to:

- Do one thing, and do it well - per the unix philosophy.
- Support the concepts of [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) and [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten).
- Be used with your own text editor (e.g., [Vim integration](#vim)).
- Be used with a local folder of markdown files.
- Be as close to zero friction as possible.
- Be lightweight and fast.

> Warning: Experimental, proof-of-concept. Here be dragons!

## Vim

Notesium is not a Vim plugin, it is up to the user to write their own
Vim commands and configure keybindings. That said, below are some fairly
generic commands, with preferences configured in the keybindings.

- Dependencies: [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) and [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim).
- Recommended: [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) for syntax highlighting in the preview.
- Recommended: [vim-markdown](https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown) for general markdown goodness.
- Recommended: [goyo.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim) and [lightlight.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/limelight.vim) for distraction free writing.

## Design assumptions and rationale

### Filenames are 8 random hexidecimal digits

> There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation
> and naming things. ~ Phil Karlton

Naming is hard. Should a convention be used? If so, which should be
used? Should it include metadata? Should it set an expectation? Should
it be consistent or free form? Should it be meaningful or random. How
long should it be. What about collisions?

With regards to notes, common conventions are to use the current date,
or note title, or both in concatenated form.

- **Dates**: The current date seems only meaningful in a journal type
  scenario. In others, it just results in long filenames and doesn't add
  much or any value. Additionally, if importing old content into the
  note system what date should be used? The date the content was
  originally written, when it was last updated, or when it was imported?
  In situations where the date created or modified is useful, they can
  be gleaned from the filesystem and/or a revision control system such
  as git.

- **Titles**: Considering notes evolve, it is likely not to be certain
  exactly what the note will encompass. And even if it is, having to
  decide on a title can paralyze or cause cognitive overload prior to
  writing the content. Existing and future collisions also need to be
  accounted for. If a better title is thought of later, or the context
  of the note changes, renaming the file would break existing links.

Given the above, the ideal would be for the filename to not matter at
all, instead opting for something short, random and unique.

Notesium assumes filenames are made up of 8 random hexidecimal digits,
with the `.md` extension, for example: `7f1c52df.md`. Given there are 16
hexidecimal digits (0-9, a-f), the total number of permutations is
`16^8`, resulting in over 4.2 billon unique filenames.

```python
>>> print "{:,}".format(len('0123456789abcdef') ** 8)
4,294,967,296
```

The `.md` extension is required so external tools can easily identify
the filetype for syntax highlighting, as well as limit the processing of
files by the parser.

### Completely flat directory structure

It is better to [prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z29hLZHiVt7W2uss2uMpSZquAX5T6vaeSF6Cy).

Folders are often thought of as categories, but notes don't always fit
neatly into just one category, which could result in decision paralysis
when creating a new note, and can prematurely constrain what may emerge.

Links would also be broken when renaming a folder or moving a note from
one folder to another.

Notesium assumes a flat directory structure, having all notes be
siblings to one another, in one directory. Utilizing bi-directional
links allows for the structure to emerge over time. Additionally, the
[label convention](#notes-with-one-word-titles-are-considered-labels) allows for a meta-hierarchical taxonomy to be created
which can be useful in certain circumstances.

### Titles are inferred from the first line

[Note titles are like APIs](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3XP5GRmd9z1D2qCE7pxUvbeSVeQuMiqz9x1C), and when titled well they become an
abstraction.

Notesium assumes note titles are on the first line of the note, in
markdown H1 format, for example: `# this is the title of a note`.

### Notes with one-word titles are considered labels

Even though [tags are an ineffective association structure](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3MzhvmesiD2htMaEFQJif7gJgyaHAQvKH49Z), Notesium
supports the concept of *labels*, but there is no special label syntax.
Instead, a *label* is just a regular note, and only considered a label
if its title is one-word.

This becomes useful, for example, when issuing the following `list`
command, each note title will be prefixed with its associated label
(multiple times for each associated label), color coded, and sorted
alphabetically, effectively creating a hierarchical taxonomy listing,
which can further be filtered and searched.

```bash
notesium list --prefix=label --sort=title --color
```

### Links are inline

[Notes should be densely linked](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2HUE4ABbQjUNjrNemvkTCsLa1LPDRuwh1tXC), allowing for structure to emerge
organically, and may even help you see unexpected connections which may
[surprise you](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4KZ9973AoHhvM9Pj5Qrds48JXNbMEwVJmVRw).

Notesium assumes note links use the inline markdown syntax, for example:
`[link text](7f1c52df.md)`. This makes it easier to parse, and simple to
insert links with a keybinding.

Even though links are short, for an improved reading experience in Vim
consider enabling `conceallevel` (see [Related Vim settings](#related-vim-settings)).

## Regression tests

Test suites for all commands and their options (except for `--color`)
are included in the `tests/` directory, along with `fixtures` acting as
a notes corpus. The tests are dependent on [bats-core](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core).

Some tests are dependent on the modification datetime of the notes
(sorting and prefixing), in which case the test suite will duplicate the
corpus to a temporary directory and modify the `mtime` deterministically
based on the note hexadecimal ID.

These test suites can be paused prior to teardown for manual inspection
and additional testing by setting the `PAUSE` environmental variable.

```bash
# run all test suites
bats tests

# run a specific test suite
bats tests/list.bats

# run a subset of tests within a specific test suite
bats tests/list.bats --filter "mtime"

# run a specific test suite, but pause prior to teardown (--tap recommended)
PAUSE=y bats tests/list.bats --tap
```
