# surely you're joking mr. feynman

excellent [book](0c8bea98.md) by [richard feynman](406c52f1.md) and [ralph leighton](12345678.md).
one of my favorite quotes:

> you have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you
> ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect
> me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing.
